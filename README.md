- CatBoost

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC and other classification metrics. Probability and rank blending techniques are used to improve overall results.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle Playground Series Season 5, Episode 12 (S5E12) diabetes prediction challenge. 
It is a synthetically generated dataset based on the Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, with the target being the probability of diagnosed diabetes.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to a real-world healthcare problem, highlighting model comparison and ensemble learning for improved prediction performance.
